World map to actual map
 - Maybe create a large actual sized sphere that renders clear to map to mini world map?
 - Than use the cubemap texture coordinates (float3) to sample cube map texture?
 - also, take the vector of the center of sphere to the player ( or the fragment that needs a sample/ color)


particles for boat waves in water shouldn't be bad because we're rendering them in the same position as we are not actually moving the boat!


Have the terrain plane be a child node to a large sphere - the map scaffolding
then rotate the scaffolding?
Same issue with vector to texturecube?
no no no, i'd need a second scaffolding for the terrain plane in addition to the regular map scaffolding


just add the damn boat as a child to the terrain for now.....
Then have the damn camera follow the rotation of the boat as well - so its always pointing downwards towards the sampled terrain texture
damn
you know what i mean
This is so I can determine what the damn problem is with rotating the terrain around the scaffolding and sometimes the tex coords get weird


Feature:
Tap on mini map to bring up the scaffolding for faster movement through the world
Have the terrain & mini map animate switching places so a miniature sized terrain shows up in the top right.


terrain lighting screwed up - goes black at some points - is because its using the rotating(with parent) matrix
normals. So at some poitn that terrain is facing away from the sun yo


different shader styles for each time of day. Morning evening night etc
