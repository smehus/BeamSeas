World map to actual map
 - Maybe create a large actual sized sphere that renders clear to map to mini world map?
 - Than use the cubemap texture coordinates (float3) to sample cube map texture?
 - also, take the vector of the center of sphere to the player ( or the fragment that needs a sample/ color)


particles for boat waves in water shouldn't be bad because we're rendering them in the same position as we are not actually moving the boat!


Have the terrain plane be a child node to a large sphere - the map scaffolding
then rotate the scaffolding?
Same issue with vector to texturecube?
no no no, i'd need a second scaffolding for the terrain plane in addition to the regular map scaffolding
